A multimodal AI application that answers questions about images using Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT).

## How to Use

2. Ask a question about it (e.g., "What color is this?", "How many people are there?")
3. Get an AI-generated answer!

## Examples

Try questions like:
- "What is in the image?"
- "What color is the object?"
- "How many people are visible?"
- "Is this indoors or outdoors?"
- "What is the person doing?"
